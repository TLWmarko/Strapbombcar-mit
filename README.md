Sourcecode for my old single-button car game released under MIT license

The game was originally created as my application to the gamedev school Futuregames in Stockholm. It was inspired by the one-button game jam that had recently finished at the time. I hacked the game on top of Twig, my physics library for DarkPlaces Quake engine.

Twig is a particle physics engine, inspired by Thomas Jakobsens "Advanced Character Physics" article series. Originally implemented in QuakeC by Ashley Hale, which I expanded on to make it appeal to a broader audience as a standalone physics library.

Does not compile by itself as the original game was released under GPL, and some parts of the sourcecode wasn't mine so I had to strip those out. The interesting parts are mainly in phys_exec.qc, editor_client.qc was butchered by gamecode.
